# Introduction 
This project is part of my seminar work for school. The task was to create a program that will work with memories, can calculate quadratic equations and can record activity. Then all the data is stored in a database which is dumped in one part into recyclerview. Where the user can see what is recorded in the database.

# What it does

- solving normal mathematic problems
- power and sqrt functions 
- storing results into 5 avaliable memories signed as M1...
- clearing the memories
- recording the what user types
- store those records into the numbers where it could be called back
- comunicating with db
- the values that are stored into values are stored into database
- solving the Quadratic Equation
