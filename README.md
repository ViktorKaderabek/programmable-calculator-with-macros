# Introduction 
It is a programmable calculator that can do everything a classical calculator can, but at the same time there are implemented memories into which the user can store arbitrary numbers.In total, 15 memories are implemented in the project. Furthermore, the project implements a method of halving intervals that can find the root of a polynomial function, the user can control the accuracy of this algorithm. The user is allowed to select the point x and point y and then the accuracy with which he wants the algorithm to work. It is also possible to store just polynomial functions or algorithm settings in memory. The last thing in the calculator are macros. They replace the sequence of what the user does. So you can program different calculations. 


# What it does
