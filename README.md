# Introduction 
This project is part of my seminar work for school. The task was to create a program that will work with memories, can calculate quadratic equations and can record activity. Then all the data is stored in a database which is dumped in one part into recyclerview. Where the user can see what is recorded in the database.

# What it does

- Solving normal mathematic problems
- Power and sqrt functions 
- Storing results into 5 avaliable memories signed as M1...
- Clearing the memories
- Recording the what user types
- Store those records into the numbers where it could be called back
- Comunicating with db
- The values that are stored into values are stored into database
- Solving the Quadratic Equation
